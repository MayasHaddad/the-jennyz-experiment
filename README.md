# The Jennyz Experiment

## What is this?

This is a UI/UX experiment around [jennyz.co](https://jennyz.co), a real world product which is used by real people.

The goal is to explore different design decisions and appreciate how they impact the user experience.

We'll introduce variations on three axes:

- Layout
- Colors
- Interaction patterns

Feel free to submit a PR to add a new variation after you read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
